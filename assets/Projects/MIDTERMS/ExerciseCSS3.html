                The North Star is Polaris, located in the constellation <a href="https://www.space.com/29649-ursa-minor-little-dipper-skywatching.html">Ursa Minor</a> It does not sit directly on the Earth&apos;s <a href="https://www.glyphweb.com/esky/concepts/northerncelestialpole.html">north celestial pole</a>, 
        but it is very close. In the northern hemisphere, Polaris is easy to identify using the Little Dipper as a reference. The stars and constellations 
        in the night sky appear to rotate around the North Star throughout the year. A common misconception about the North Star is that it is the brightest 
        star in the sky, but that is not true.

                Polaris, or commonly known as The North Star, is located almost directly above the North Celestial Pole marking the way due north. Polaris is 
        not the <a href="https://www.star-facts.com/brightest-stars/">brightest star</a> in the night sky. However, it is easily located making it a reliable gauge of North for travelers without a compass.
        In this article, I&apos;ll explain how to find the North Star is in the night sky and some interesting facts about Earth&apos;s pole star.

                As you travel northward, Polaris climbs higher in the sky. If you go as far north as the North Pole, Polaris will appear directly overhead. As 
        you travel south, Polaris drops closer to the northern horizon. From the equator, Polaris sinks to the horizon and cannot be seen from the South of the 
        equator. In the Northern Hemisphere, finding Polaris means you know the direction north. Even when the full moon obscures the sky, the North Star is 
        relatively easy to see. Polaris&apos; position is RA: 2h 31m 48.7s, dec: +89° 15&apos; 51″.

                Polaris is easy to find if you can first locate the <a href="https://www.constellation-guide.com/little-dipper/">Little Dipper</a>, Ursa Minor. Polaris lies at the end of the handle in the Little Dipper and 
        can also be located by finding the <a href="https://www.constellation-guide.com/big-dipper/">Big Dipper</a>, Ursa Major. To locate Polaris, find the Big Dipper pointer stars Dubhe and Merak. These two stars 
        outline the outer part of the Big Dipper&apos;s bowl. Draw an imaginary line from Merak through Dubhe, and follow it straight to Polaris and the Little Dipper.
        The Big Dipper lies below the little dipper and their handles point in opposite directions. The Big Dipper, like a great big hour hand, goes a full counter-clockwise 
        circle around Polaris in one day. Even though the Big Dipper travels around Polaris all night long, the Big Dipper pointer stars always point to Polaris on any day 
        of the year, and at any time of the night.

        The following steps will help you locate the North Star in the northern hemisphere sky. It is not difficult to find it as long as it sits high enough in the sky from 
        your <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/latitude">latitude</a> and obstructions, such as large tree, are not blocking your view. 

        1. Locate the Big Dipper (7 stars)
        2. Find the 2 bright stars that form the side of the bowl opposite to the tip of the handle
        3. Draw an imaginary line through these 2 bright stars
        4. Extend the line until you reach a star of similar brightness about 5 x the distance of these 2 stars
        5 The bright star found here is Polaris, the North Star

                You can also find the North Star by locating the tip of the Little Dipper&apos;s handle, but this asterism can be difficult to find in the city. The Little Dipper is 
        often referred to as the “Host of the North Star“. The amount of local <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/light-pollution">light pollution</a> in your location can make seeing stars difficult. You can find out where your 
        backyard falls in the Bortle Scale using this guide.
